# Assignment2
Your Project's Name
(One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Tell us about your project.)
Our project is an ecommerce platform that sells merchandise. It also includes the addition of a game where users can earn points for redemption upon
checking out their shopping carts.

Design Process
(Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.)
Our design process started by brainstorming what we wanted our website to be based off. We then settled on the theme and the features of the ecommerce platform. This website is for Bluelock fans to buy merchandise and play an interactive game to earn redemption points, but it is also targeted at users
who do not know what is Bluelock. Our website has relevant information that introduces Bluelock, which can help increase fanbase or customerbase. 

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

Features
(In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.)
Our features include a home page, shop page, about page, game page, contact page and cart page. The home page includes the different features our page provides and some featured products from the webstore. As for the shop page, it has the different products offered/sold which can be viewed by users. The about page talks about Bluelock, so that new users have a brief understanding of what our website is all about. As the the game page, it involves a simple interactive ball game where users can earn points through it. The accumulated points can be used as discount/offset once they get to the cart page. The contact page then shows where the current physical store is and ways to contact the store/company. A feedback form is also included to take in feedbacks/thoughts from customers/users to help improve our website or services. The cart page allows users to cart out and buy products. There is also a login and register account page for both new and current users.

- Jquery
- Zim Physics Library
- RestDB


(In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.)

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as: when changing html elements' content and when communicating with the database

ZIM Physics Library(https://zimjs.com/physics/)
This library was used in order to create the minigame. It was used to give the object physics such as bounce and gravity in order for the game to work

RestDB(https://restdb.io):
Rest DB was used as a database to store product details as well as user details in order to create a login and register function

AdobeXD:
Used to create a wireframe in order to facilitate idea generation and outline for website 

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

Game:
Does not give the user points that can be redeemed for money. There is no set limit on the number of games that can be played per day

Cart:
