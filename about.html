            <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
            <p>A group of young teenagers who are pursing their dreams of being the world's best striker.
                BlueLock is a programme made by Ego, who also invited 300 potential U18 soccer players in Japan
                to hop onto his creation. Soccer players are slowly eliminated through matches and different stages,
                and for those who fail to go onto the next stage, their dreams are crushed right on the spot as 
                their soccer career is entirely destroyed.
            </p>

                Their extraordinary egoism is the one thing Japan’s football lacks. You will not become the greatest 
                strikers in the world, unless you have the ego to match. My purpose here, is to create such a player in Japan.”
